          PLAY TO EARN

          Owning an Akuto gives you absolute access to our upcoming Play to Earn (P2E) game called Shinigami Sins: Revenge of Satsujin, a Metaverse Multi-player game built on blockchain technology. 

          The background of the game is about Shinigami Satsujin’s path of taking revenge against Amaterasu, the celestial sun goddess who sealed him in the underworld for 1000 years. In this game, you will be using your Akuto NFTs, to level-up, defeat the legion of Amaterasu, and help Shinigami Satsujin reclaim the throne that was once his. Upgrade your weapons, buy new sets of armor, and learn demonic powers to climb your way up to the leaderboard.

          Akuto owners will be given, through airdrop, $SINS (native token) which can be used as a startup in playing our P2E. GRINDERS can participate through our Daily Events, PvE tasks, PvP tasks, Recurring Events, Leaderboard Events so as to earn more rewards. STAKERS can hodl and stake their $SINS for additional yield, in-game boosts, and other privilages.

          <p  className="text-blue-900">
          Shinigami Sins: Revenge of Satsujin works around the native token $SINS.  As you participate through our Daily Events and other tasks, you will be rewarded with more $SINS, which can be used to upgrade your weapons and learn new skills. Moreover, players can also HODL and stake their $SINS for additional in-game yield.
